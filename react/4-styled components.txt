install styled-components
    -yarn add styled-components



if you want to import both styled and react component at the same time
    -either change the name
        or
    -use aliasing 
        import {Button as CustomButton}


export const Button = styled.button
    .button is used to define tag
        eg: .h1, .section, .div
