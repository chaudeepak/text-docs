-<Form> component props: action method encType (use this when you dont need async submission) (not using now)
-in react we work with async submission 
    -form ko data linxau 
    -clint side ko sabai kaam sakauxau (ie: mapping, validation)
        -then we submit through some async methods : list to onSubmit method 


yarn add axios

all functions in axios are asynchronous 

npn i CORS (in servers side only)


Interceptors:
    -axiosInstance.intetceptors.response.use(
        (success) => {
            return success;
        }
        (reject) => {
            //handler error
        }
    )

hook function is not async function
